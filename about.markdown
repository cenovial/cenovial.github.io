# Remy's Recipes
This website is one of two projects I am working on to familiarize myself with *HTML*, *CSS*, and the basics of web development. My other project, called [Teachervini](https://teachervini.com), is a website hosted by **Google Sites**. Google Sites makes it *incredibly* quick & easy to publish a polished website, because it offers a variety of design templates to choose from and uses dropdown menus & user-friendly interfaces to modify general elements. However, the interface limits your ability to customize more specific components of a webpage. In addition, for my purposes, I needed to find a different service that would allow me to gain more experience with HTML & CSS. 

Hence, for this project, I will be utilizing **GitHub Pages**, a *static* site hosting service that can publish a website directly from a GitHub repository, which contains your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. By giving you control over the code used to develop your website, GitHub Pages offers endless options in customization and ensures that you can modify every detail of your pages' content without any limitations. To make site production even easier, I will be using **Jekyll**, a program that can transform plain text from different formats, such as HTML & markdown, into static webpages and blogs ready for deployment and publishing by GitHub Pages.
